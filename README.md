Just a repo for me to try out some of the examples from the book "secrets of the Java Script Ninja"

####[Function Declarations] (https://github.com/davidkethel/javaScriptNinja/blob/master/functionDeclaration.html)####

This page demonstrates the different ways to declare functions. 

* Including a named function that is available through a property of the window.
* An anonymous function that is a available through a property of the window. 
* An anonymous function that is available as a property of the window explicitly. 

It also demonstrates forware referencing, where by a function is in scope before it has been declared. And the difference between the function name and the window property it is available through.
