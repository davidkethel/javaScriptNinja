Just a repo for me to try out some of the examples from the book "secrets of the Java Script Ninja", and record what I learnt

####[Function Declarations] (https://github.com/davidkethel/javaScriptNinja/blob/master/functionDeclaration.html)####

This page demonstrates the different ways to declare functions. 

Including
* A named function that is available through a property of the window.
* An anonymous function that is a available through a property of the window. 
* An anonymous function that is available as a property of the window explicitly. 

It also demonstrates forware referencing, where by a function is in scope before it has been declared. And the difference between the function name and the window property it is available through.


####[Outer Inner Scope] (https://github.com/davidkethel/javaScriptNinja/blob/master/outerInnerScope.html) ####

Scope in javascript is not defined by braces but rather by function declarations, and that the global scope acts like on big function definition.

Named functions are in scope within the entire function in which they are declared. 

Variables are in scope after they have been decalred to the end of the function in which they are declared.
